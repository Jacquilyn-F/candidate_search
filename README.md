# Candidate Search

## Project Overview

This project implements a candidate search application that interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve and display candidate information. The application allows users to view candidate profiles, save potential candidates to a list, and manage the saved candidates. The app is built using TypeScript and deployed on Render.

## Features

- **GitHub API Integration**: The app fetches candidate data from the GitHub API, including the candidateâ€™s name, username, location, avatar, email, HTML URL, and company.
- **Save Potential Candidates**: Users can save candidates by clicking the "+" button, which adds the candidate to a list of potential candidates.
- **Reject Candidates**: Users can skip candidates by clicking the "-" button, which moves to the next candidate without saving the current one.
- **Persistent Saved Candidates List**: The list of saved candidates persists even after the page reloads using local storage.
- **Candidate Information**: For each candidate, the following information is displayed:
  - Name
  - Username
  - Location
  - Avatar
  - Email
  - HTML URL
  - Company
- **Empty State Handling**: Appropriate messages are shown when there are no candidates to review or when there are no saved candidates.
